Prerequisites
=============

* libquvi  0.4.0+  <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>


Installation from source
========================

REMINDER: Run "make uninstall" if you have installed quvi from the
source previously.

  * How to use GNU Autotools build system falls outside of the scope of
  this documentation, refer to the appropriate sources instead

  * IF you are unsure, THEN do not install from the source
    - quvi is available to many distros as a precompiled package

    - Precompiled packages (ideally) make sure that no old files are
      left behind when the software is upgraded or uninstalled

    - Any old files left behind on your system may potentially interfere
      with the new version of quvi

  * Consider yourself reminded

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
If you are compiling quvi from the development code from the git
repository, see "Installation from development code", instead.

  --without-manual    Do not install manual page(s)


Installation from development code
==================================

If you are compiling quvi from the development code, run "autogen.sh",
first. This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * GNU Autotools (autoconf, automake, etc.)
  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU gengetopt

Once the files have been generated, follow the instructions in "Installation
from source" above.
